// Package version pins the single source of truth for the tabsmith version.
//
// Everything that prints a version (the CLI, the generated-script headers,
// the smoke test) reads this constant, so a release bump is a one-line
// change here plus a CHANGELOG entry.
package version

// Version is the semantic version of tabsmith.
// Keep CHANGELOG.md in lockstep when changing it.
